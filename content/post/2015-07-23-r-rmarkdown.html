<h1>Abstract:</h1>
<p>Income situation matters for our lives in almost all aspects, including living standards, consumption ideas, and investment preference. In this analysis, I use two variables related to income in the CES datasets. I find that for most of the participants, they are willing to answer the income question, and the participant’s income is close to the data provided by Statistics Canada.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>On June 13rd, 2019, Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship in the 2019 NBA Finals. It was also the first time that a Canadian team won the Championship. Bianca Andreescu, who defeated Serena Williams and won the US Open champion in 2019. She became the first Canadian tennis player who wins a Grand Slam title, and she was only 19. The same year, the Canadian federal election was held in October. The year 2019 is an extraordinary year for both the country and the people. Because of the special of 2019, I hope to find something interesting in the Canadian Election Study (CES) datasets. During the CES datasets’ data analysis, my central concern is the total household income before taxes for the year 2018. I did some research before about Canadian income. According to the Canadian income survey released on February 24th, 2020 by Statistics Canada, the median after-tax income in 2018 is $61,400. One of my interesting topics is using the CES dataset to observe the survey’s income condition and compare it with the Statistics Canada data.</p>
<p>Based on the CES data’s income part, I used the income number and income category as my analysis target. The participant is asked the exact household income number first. Those who did not answer this question will ask for the income category. For the first question, the income number, around 68% of participants answer the question. About 76% of the rest of the participants answer the second question. Because both variables are important, I decided to summarize the income numbers data, which is relatively more observation than income category. I compare this data with the Statistics Canada data, and then I made a histogram for the data of income categories to see the distribution.</p>
<p>To begin with the analysis, I briefly introduce the CES data and then summarize one of the variables. After that, I made a histogram for other income variables, which is the income category. In the end, discuss the main finding during the analysis and some disadvantages that can be improved.</p>

<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The CES datasets is a large investigation of the citizens during the election year since 1965. There are hundreds of questions, including income, education, gender, age, vote, etc. All of this valuable data embody Canadian’s political preference, and it is also provides a record of Canadian’s social attitude.</p>

<div id="income-number-data-summarization" class="section level1">
<h1>Income number data summarization</h1>
<p>The variables I focus on summarizing is the total household income number in 2018. After I omit the non-response answer and outliers, I found that the participant’s mean is 85910 Canadian dollars, and the standard deviation is 87043. As for the comparing data, the median of before-tax income is $72000 for 25534 participants. Although the after-tax income will depend on where you live, the median is closed to the data provided by Statistics Canada, which is 61400 Canadian dollars after-tax income.</p>

<h1>Graph Discussion</h1>
<p>The distribution of the income category in the 2019 CES datasets is skewed right. The mean (red line) of the income category is in the fourth category ($60001 - $90000). The graph shows that the median(cyan line) is in category 3 (before-tax income $30001-$60000). In fact the participant’s actual median perhaps will close to $60000, and this is also detail that can be improved. The graph shows that the median is in category 3; however, the range of category 3 is between 30001 Canadian dollars and 60000 Canadian dollars, which is a relative board interval. If we can narrow the range, we can have a more specific prediction about the income level. The survey will display the income category question if the participant did not answer the income number question. Therefore, the sample size of the income category is not enough to show all of the participant income levels. Besides that, there is still part of participants who did not answer both of the questions, and it will also cause the inaccurate of the data.</p>

<div id="weakness-and-future-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Weakness and future work</h1>
<p>One of the most apparent weaknesses during the investigation is the lack of participants. Although there are 37822 observations, compared with the population in Canada, which is more than 37,000,000, the number of participants is seemingly small. If we can receive a larger sample size, we can predict more accurately. I want to analyze the CES dataset in the future for finding more interesting data. I already have some basic ideas, for example, depending on different income or education levels, which is the primary concern for citizenship during the election year.</p>
